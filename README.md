# Gym App

A simple React app that queries an API and displays a list of exercises. <br />
This is the first project I've done in React, and my first 'proper' exposure to react beyond small tutorials/'what is React' type things. <br />
I used a variety of learning resources including Stack Overflow (naturally!), the official docs, and a course on [Ultimate courses](https://ultimatecourses.com/). <br />

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Demo on AWS Amplify with CD Pipeline from Master Branch - [LIVE DEMO](https://master.d2yxugw2wrc01u.amplifyapp.com/).

## TODO

* (More) Unit tests (especially for each component)
* Continue learning React (I'm genuinely really impressed with it)

## Launching the project locally

Clone the project - `git clone https://github.com/LaurenceStokes/gym-app.git $destinationName` <br />
Cd into the project directory and run:

### `npm i`

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Testing

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
